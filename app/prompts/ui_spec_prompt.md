You will be given:
- a baseline `ui-spec`
- a source payload (openapi/figma/wireframe)
- org theme tokens

Your task:
1) Improve the baseline ui-spec:
   - better page names
   - routes normalized
   - sections mapped to operationIds where possible
2) Ensure schema correctness.
3) Return ONLY JSON (the final ui-spec).

Do not include any additional keys beyond:
- appName
- theme
- source
- pages
